\begin{abstract}
The Minimum Connected Vertex Cover (CVC) problem, a variant of the Minimum Vertex Cover (VC) problem, aims to find a minimum-cardinality subset of the vertices of a given graph such that the subgraph induced by those vertices is connected. A fundamental result related to the CVC problem is that if the leaves of a spanning tree of the graph are independent (\ie{} not adjacent to each other in the graph), then the internal vertices of this tree provides a 2-approximation for the graph's CVC. In this paper, building upon the fact that the depth-first search algorithm (DFS) can be used to obtain an independent-leaves spanning tree of a graph, we compare the efficacy of variations of DFS for obtaining an approximation of the optimal CVC. In particular, we compare four different ordering heuristics commonly used in greedy graph coloring (with two variations, forward and reverse, for each heuristic), to use with DFS: decreasing-degree, smallest-degree-last, smallest-log-degree-last, and saturation-degree. Our experiments on small real-world graphs show that, at least for graphs with small number of vertices, the decreasing-degree heuristic almost always performs at least as good as the others in terms of approximation ratio, and the forward variant of each ordering almost always performs at least as good as the reverse variant.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Given an undirected connected graph $G=(V,E)$, a vertex subset $V'\subseteq V$ is called a \emph{vertex cover} of~$G$ if every edge $(u,v)\in E$ is incident to some vertex in~$V'$, that is, $u\in V'$ or $v\in V'$. The \emph{minimum vertex cover} problem (VC) aims to find a vertex cover with minimum cardinality. The \emph{minimum connected vertex cover} problem (CVC) is a variation of the vertex cover problem where the aim is to find a minimum vertex cover~$C$ of a graph~$G$ such that the subgraph of~$G$ induced by the vertices~$C$ is connected.

First introduced by Garey and Johnson~\cite{garey_rectilinear_1977}, the CVC problem typically arises in situations that necessitate finding a vertex cover of a network while maintaining certain connectivity constraints on possible solutions. As an example, canonical use case of CVC, from the field of wireless network design, is the problem of minimizing the number of relay stations that need to be placed on a network's nodes so that they form a connected subnetwork and every transmission link is incident to at least one relay station \cite{moser_exact_2005}.

\textbf{Contributions: }
Our main contribution in this paper is a comparative study of the efficay four different vertex ordering heuristics commonly used in greedy graph coloring algorithms, for obtaining a CVC using depth-first search. The source code used to run the experiments, along with instructions on how to compile and run them, can be found at the following remote Git repository: \verb|https://github.com/tahmid-khan/cvc-approximation|

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:rel-work}
Savage~\cite{savage_depth-first_1982} proved that the internal vertices of a DFS spanning tree give a 2-approximation for the CVC; this is one of the main results our approach is based on. Most of the approaches to approximating CVC make use of approximations of \textit{tree cover} problem, in which the objective is to compute a minimum edge set $T$ such that $T$ is connected and every edge outside of $T$ is adjacent to at least one in~$T$~\cite{fujito_2-approximation_2004}. Fujito \etal~\cite{fujito_2-approximation_2004} proposed a $\mathcal{O}(\log^2n)$-time algorithm that uses maximal matchings to find a 2-approximation to CVC. Better approximation algorithms for CVC exist for special connected graphs, such as a $\frac{2k}{k+2}+\mathcal{O}(1/n)$-approximation algorithm for $k$-regular graphs \cite{li_connected_2019}.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:method}
Our methodology is based on the following facts: (1) the internal vertices of an independence tree form a connected vertex cover, and (2) the d-leaves (leaves that are not the root) of a DFS spanning tree~$T$ of a graph~$G$ are $G$-independent (not adjacent in $G$) \cite{savage_depth-first_1982,salamon_degree-based_2010}. After obtaining the DFS spanning tree, we apply a modification of the ILST algorithm by Salamon~\cite{salamon_degree-based_2010} to obtain an independence tree all of whose leaves, including the root if it is a leaf, are $G$-independent. Algorithm~\ref{alg:algo}) is our modification Salamon's ILST:

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{{\textsc{Modified-ILST}($G, \rho$)}
\label{alg:algo}}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Require $G=(V,E)$ is a connected graph
\Require $\rho : V\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ maps each vertex to a unique integer
\State $T \gets \hbox{\textsc{DFS-Traversal}}(G, \rho)$
\State $r \gets$ the root of $T$
\If{$T$ has at least one branching (vertex with degree 2), $\deg_T(r) = 1$, and $T$ has a leaf~$l$ s.t. $(r,l)\in E$}
    \State Add edge $(l, r)$ to $T$.
    \State $b \gets$ the branching of $T$ closest to $l$
    \State $c \gets$ the child of $b$ in $T$ that is closest to $l$
    \State Delete edge $(b, c)$ from $T$.
\EndIf\\
\Return $T$
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

The \textsc{Modified-ILST} algorithm differs from Salamon's version only on the first line, where we are incorporating a priority function $\rho : V\rightarrow\mathbb{Z}$ that determines which of the unvisited neighbors of a vertex will be visited next while building the DFS tree; the neighbor with the highest priority gets visited first.

The priority function gives a ordering heuristic for the depth-first traversal, and a comparison of some choices for this heuristic is the main subject of our study.
We experimented with four choices for the ordering heuristic (with two variations for each: forward and reverse).

The simplest of these heuristics is what we are calling \emph{decreasing degree} (\textbf{DD}): the vertices are sorted in decreasing (or non-increasing, to be more accurate) order, so that the vertex with the highest degree gets the highest priority. Ties are broken using an arbitrary value: the vertices' labels, which we have chosen to be unique ordinal numbers.
The other four choices are ordering heuristics popularly used in greedy graph coloring algorithms \cite{hasenplaugh_ordering_2014}:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{SL}: \emph{smallest degree last}, also known as reverse degeneracy ordering \cite{matula_smallest-last_1983};
    \item \textbf{SLL}: \emph{smallest log-degree last}, introduced by Hasenplaugh \etal{}~\cite{hasenplaugh_ordering_2014};
    \item \textbf{SD}: \emph{saturation degree}-based ordering \cite{brelaz_new_1979,hasenplaugh_ordering_2014}.
\end{itemize}

When feasible (\ie{} the graph is small enough), we are also considering the optimal CVC cardinality of a graph in our experiments by running a brute-force algorithm.

\section{Dataset}
\label{sec:data}
For our experiments, we are using 31 graphs from the Network Repository~\cite{nr} that are simple (loop-free) and connected.
At  least~14 of them have degree less than 30, so that the performance of our methods can be compared against optimal minimum connected vertex cover of those graphs, which require exponential-order time to run.
% We have used two types of network datasets in this work -- which are described below.

% \subsection{Synthetic Dataset}\label{sec:synth}
% Describe the methodology you used to generate your synthetic graphs: which network-generation model and parameter settings you used and why (justifications). Also mention important properties of those graphs, for e.g. no. of nodes, no. of edges (range), clustering coefficient, etc.

% \subsection{Real Dataset}\label{sec:real}
% Describe from which source (for e.g. The Network Repository\footnote{\url{https://networkrepository.com/networks.php}}) you collected real network data. Briefly describe which types of networks you collected and why. Also mention preprocessing steps you employed to clean the dataset (e.g. removing self-loops, multi-edges, removing/applying directions, etc.). Also prepare a table mentioning the properties of these graphs (Table~\ref{tab:real-graphs}).

\section{Experiments}
\label{sec:expt}
% \textbf{Experimental Setup: }
For each graph, we are running the \textsc{Modified-ILST} algorithm with eight priority functions: the four ordering heuristics, once forward and once backward (in reverse order), and we are recording the cardinality of the resulting vertex covers from each heuristic.

For the smaller graphs (order $< 30$), we are also obtaining the minimum connected vertex cover's cardinality by running a brute-force algorithm. This enables us to see the performance of the heuristics in terms of approximation ratio, too.

% \textbf{Investigation: }
% Mention sources from which you collected code of competitor algorithms,  which parameters were chosen for those algorithms and your algorithm with justifications of those choices, which sequence of steps you taken in your experiment, etc.

% \textbf{Evaluation: }
% Mention how you evaluate (e.g. via precision, recall, etc. in case of ML algorithms) algorithms. For e.g. you can use the following performance metrics for comparing algorithms.

% (i) $\text{Speedup w.r.t. algorithm}~B = \frac{\text{Execution Time of B}}{\text{Execution Time of A}}$\\
% (ii) $\text{RSS ratio w.r.t. algorithm B} = \frac{\text{Maximum RSS of B}}{\text{Maximum RSS of A}}$\\

% Here $B$ is a competitor algorithm and $A$ is our algorithm. Execution time is the total time of taken by the process inside (for system calls) and outside (in the user space) the kernel. Note that \textit{Speedup} can have any real value -- the higher it is, the faster $A$~is, as compared to its competitor. Specifically, its value $> 1$ indicates that $A$~is more efficient than its competitor $B$ and vice versa. On the other hand, RSS is an abbreviation for \textit{resident set size}, which indicates the amount of RAM space allocated to that process. Its value varies during the execution of the process, so we consider the maximum value of it. RSS ratio can have any real value -- the higher it is, the better $A$ is -- as compared to its competitor $B$ in terms of memory consumption.\\
%It includes stack and heap memory and also shared libraries used by the process provided that the libraries are in the RAM.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:result}

Tables~\ref{tab:results} and \ref{tab:res2} give the results of these experiments. In these tables, for each graph, the results of the best-performing heuristics are emphasized with boldface font, and the results of the second best--performing heuristics (if there are more than one different results in the graph), with italic font. We make the following observations about the results in :
\begin{itemize}
    \item The DD-forward ordering provides the best ordering strategy for all but 6 of the 31 graphs used in the experiments.
    \item With one exception (\verb|biplane-9|), for a graph for where DD-forward does not give the best approximation, it gives the second best performance.
    \item With few exceptions in the case of the SD heuristic, the forward version of a heuristic always gives at least as good an approximation as its reverse version.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusion and Future Directions}
\label{sec:conc}
As a potentially counter-intuitive result, our results suggest that the DD algorithm, which runs in linear time with only linear additional memory, outperforms the other more sophisticated and more complex vertex-ordering algorithms for finding an approximate solution to the minimum connected vertex problem using DFS spanning trees.

Further investigations may elucidate on why this is the case. It may be fruitful to attempt to establish a causal relationship between the properties of a graph and the best ordering heuristic for finding or approximating its CVC.

Future research with should also make an attempt to compare the results of the CVC-approximation technique studied in this work to those of other papers, such as Fujuto's 2-approximation algorithm that uses maximal matchings \cite{fujito_2-approximation_2004}.

% conclude and mention some future work on this work.

% \section*{\textbf{Latex Template Usage Instructions}}
% This document is a model and instructions for \LaTeX. This and the IEEEtran.cls file define the components of your paper [title, text, heads, etc.]. *CRITICAL: Do Not Use Symbols, Special Characters, Footnotes, or Math in Paper Title or Abstract.

% \subsection{Maintaining the Integrity of the Specifications}
% The IEEEtran class file is used to format your paper and style the text. All margins,
% column widths, line spaces, and text fonts are prescribed; please do not
% alter them. You may note peculiarities. For example, the head margin
% measures proportionately more than is customary. This measurement
% and others are deliberate, using specifications that anticipate your paper
% as one part of the entire proceedings, and not as an independent document.
% Please do not revise any of the current designations.

% \section{Prepare Your Paper Before Styling}
% Before you begin to format your paper, first write and save the content as a
% separate text file. Complete all content and organizational editing before
% formatting. Please note sections \ref{AA}--\ref{SCM} below for more information on
% proofreading, spelling and grammar.

% Keep your text and graphic files separate until after the text has been
% formatted and styled. Do not number text heads---{\LaTeX} will do that
% for you.

% \subsection{Abbreviations and Acronyms}\label{AA}
% Define abbreviations and acronyms the first time they are used in the text,
% even after they have been defined in the abstract. Abbreviations such as
% IEEE, SI, MKS, CGS, ac, dc, and rms do not have to be defined. Do not use
% abbreviations in the title or heads unless they are unavoidable.

% \subsection{Units}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Use either SI (MKS) or CGS as primary units. (SI units are encouraged.) English units may be used as secondary units (in parentheses). An exception would be the use of English units as identifiers in trade, such as ``3.5-inch disk drive''.
% \item Avoid combining SI and CGS units, such as current in amperes and magnetic field in oersteds. This often leads to confusion because equations do not balance dimensionally. If you must use mixed units, clearly state the units for each quantity that you use in an equation.
% \item Do not mix complete spellings and abbreviations of units: ``Wb/m\textsuperscript{2}'' or ``webers per square meter'', not ``webers/m\textsuperscript{2}''. Spell out units when they appear in text: ``. . . a few henries'', not ``. . . a few H''.
% \item Use a zero before decimal points: ``0.25'', not ``.25''. Use ``cm\textsuperscript{3}'', not ``cc''.)
% \end{itemize}

% \subsection{Equations}
% Number equations consecutively. To make your
% equations more compact, you may use the solidus (~/~), the exp function, or
% appropriate exponents. Italicize Roman symbols for quantities and variables,
% but not Greek symbols. Use a long dash rather than a hyphen for a minus
% sign. Punctuate equations with commas or periods when they are part of a
% sentence, as in:
% \begin{equation}
% a+b=\gamma\label{eq}
% \end{equation}

% Be sure that the
% symbols in your equation have been defined before or immediately following
% the equation. Use ``\eqref{eq}'', not ``Eq.~\eqref{eq}'' or ``equation \eqref{eq}'', except at
% the beginning of a sentence: ``Equation \eqref{eq} is . . .''

% \subsection{\LaTeX-Specific Advice}

% Please use ``soft'' (e.g., \verb|\eqref{Eq}|) cross references instead
% of ``hard'' references (e.g., \verb|(1)|). That will make it possible
% to combine sections, add equations, or change the order of figures or
% citations without having to go through the file line by line.

% Please don't use the \verb|{eqnarray}| equation environment. Use
% \verb|{align}| or \verb|{IEEEeqnarray}| instead. The \verb|{eqnarray}|
% environment leaves unsightly spaces around relation symbols.

% Please note that the \verb|{subequations}| environment in {\LaTeX}
% will increment the main equation counter even when there are no
% equation numbers displayed. If you forget that, you might write an
% article in which the equation numbers skip from (17) to (20), causing
% the copy editors to wonder if you've discovered a new method of
% counting.

% {\BibTeX} does not work by magic. It doesn't get the bibliographic
% data from thin air but from .bib files. If you use {\BibTeX} to produce a
% bibliography you must send the .bib files.

% {\LaTeX} can't read your mind. If you assign the same label to a
% subsubsection and a table, you might find that Table I has been cross
% referenced as Table IV-B3.

% {\LaTeX} does not have precognitive abilities. If you put a
% \verb|\label| command before the command that updates the counter it's
% supposed to be using, the label will pick up the last counter to be
% cross referenced instead. In particular, a \verb|\label| command
% should not go before the caption of a figure or a table.

% Do not use \verb|\nonumber| inside the \verb|{array}| environment. It
% will not stop equation numbers inside \verb|{array}| (there won't be
% any anyway) and it might stop a wanted equation number in the
% surrounding equation.

% \subsection{Some Common Mistakes}\label{SCM}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item The word ``data'' is plural, not singular.
% \item The subscript for the permeability of vacuum $\mu_{0}$, and other common scientific constants, is zero with subscript formatting, not a lowercase letter ``o''.
% \item In American English, commas, semicolons, periods, question and exclamation marks are located within quotation marks only when a complete thought or name is cited, such as a title or full quotation. When quotation marks are used, instead of a bold or italic typeface, to highlight a word or phrase, punctuation should appear outside of the quotation marks. A parenthetical phrase or statement at the end of a sentence is punctuated outside of the closing parenthesis (like this). (A parenthetical sentence is punctuated within the parentheses.)
% \item A graph within a graph is an ``inset'', not an ``insert''. The word alternatively is preferred to the word ``alternately'' (unless you really mean something that alternates).
% \item Do not use the word ``essentially'' to mean ``approximately'' or ``effectively''.
% \item In your paper title, if the words ``that uses'' can accurately replace the word ``using'', capitalize the ``u''; if not, keep using lower-cased.
% \item Be aware of the different meanings of the homophones ``affect'' and ``effect'', ``complement'' and ``compliment'', ``discreet'' and ``discrete'', ``principal'' and ``principle''.
% \item Do not confuse ``imply'' and ``infer''.
% \item The prefix ``non'' is not a word; it should be joined to the word it modifies, usually without a hyphen.
% \item There is no period after the ``et'' in the Latin abbreviation ``et al.''.
% \item The abbreviation ``i.e.'' means ``that is'', and the abbreviation ``e.g.'' means ``for example''.
% \end{itemize}
% An excellent style manual for science writers is \cite{b7}.

% \subsection{Authors and Affiliations}
% \textbf{The class file is designed for, but not limited to, six authors.} A
% minimum of one author is required for all conference articles. Author names
% should be listed starting from left to right and then moving down to the
% next line. This is the author sequence that will be used in future citations
% and by indexing services. Names should not be listed in columns nor group by
% affiliation. Please keep your affiliations as succinct as possible (for
% example, do not differentiate among departments of the same organization).

% \subsection{Identify the Headings}
% Headings, or heads, are organizational devices that guide the reader through
% your paper. There are two types: component heads and text heads.

% Component heads identify the different components of your paper and are not
% topically subordinate to each other. Examples include Acknowledgments and
% References and, for these, the correct style to use is ``Heading 5''. Use
% ``figure caption'' for your Figure captions, and ``table head'' for your
% table title. Run-in heads, such as ``Abstract'', will require you to apply a
% style (in this case, italic) in addition to the style provided by the drop
% down menu to differentiate the head from the text.

% Text heads organize the topics on a relational, hierarchical basis. For
% example, the paper title is the primary text head because all subsequent
% material relates and elaborates on this one topic. If there are two or more
% sub-topics, the next level head (uppercase Roman numerals) should be used
% and, conversely, if there are not at least two sub-topics, then no subheads
% should be introduced.

% \subsection{Figures and Tables}
% \paragraph{Positioning Figures and Tables} Place figures and tables at the top and
% bottom of columns. Avoid placing them in the middle of columns. Large
% figures and tables may span across both columns. Figure captions should be
% below the figures; table heads should appear above the tables. Insert
% figures and tables after they are cited in the text. Use the abbreviation
% ``Fig.~\ref{fig}'', even at the beginning of a sentence.

% \end{figure}

% Figure Labels: Use 8 point Times New Roman for Figure labels. Use words
% rather than symbols or abbreviations when writing Figure axis labels to
% avoid confusing the reader. As an example, write the quantity
% ``Magnetization'', or ``Magnetization, M'', not just ``M''. If including
% units in the label, present them within parentheses. Do not label axes only
% with units. In the example, write ``Magnetization (A/m)'' or ``Magnetization
% \{A[m(1)]\}'', not just ``A/m''. Do not label axes with a ratio of
% quantities and units. For example, write ``Temperature (K)'', not
% ``Temperature/K''.

% \section*{Acknowledgment}

% The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without
% an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B.
% G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor
% acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.

% \section*{References}

% Please number citations consecutively within brackets \cite{b1}. The
% sentence punctuation follows the bracket \cite{b2}. Refer simply to the reference
% number, as in \cite{b3}---do not use ``Ref. \cite{b3}'' or ``reference \cite{b3}'' except at
% the beginning of a sentence: ``Reference \cite{b3} was the first $\ldots$''

% Number footnotes separately in superscripts. Place the actual footnote at
% the bottom of the column in which it was cited. Do not put footnotes in the
% abstract or reference list. Use letters for table footnotes.

% Unless there are six authors or more give all authors' names; do not use
% ``et al.''. Papers that have not been published, even if they have been
% submitted for publication, should be cited as ``unpublished'' \cite{b4}. Papers
% that have been accepted for publication should be cited as ``in press'' \cite{b5}.
% Capitalize only the first word in a paper title, except for proper nouns and
% element symbols.

% For papers published in translation journals, please give the English
% citation first, followed by the original foreign-language citation \cite{b6}.
